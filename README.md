## Overview

Portwise is a desktop-first web app that turns a container terminal into a living control room. It follows **Seastar Lines**, a fictional carrier, through **Pasir Panjang Terminal, Port of Singapore**. The terminal faces south onto the Singapore Strait. The clock runs on SGT (UTC+8) and the AIS positions use real coordinates around 1.2735° N, 103.7695° E.

The whole viewport is a low-poly three.js scene that never stops moving:

- **8 berths** with **7 vessels alongside** and **14 ship-to-shore (STS) quay cranes**
- A **40-block container yard** (A1–D10) with thousands of colour-coded boxes
- A **gate plaza**, an empty depot and **19 gate trucks** plus **8 drayage trucks**
- **Strait traffic** in a Traffic Separation Scheme, the **Western Anchorage**, pilots and tugs
- A full **logistics district** behind the terminal with an expressway, a rail terminal, warehouses, cold chain, customs X-ray, factories, a bunker terminal, HDB estates and a downtown skyline

The UI floats over the scene as crisp paper panels. The look is "morning nautical chart": cream chart paper, ink-navy type, signal-orange accents and pale seafoam water.

> **The simulation runs entirely client-side.** There is no backend, no API key and no real AIS feed. Clone it, run it, and the port comes alive.
>
> Flip the **Live cluster** switch and the same scene becomes a read-only view of a Kubernetes cluster: nodes berth as ships, namespaces fill the yard, pods ride on deck, and image pulls and scheduling decisions drive the trucks. See [Live cluster mode](#live-cluster-mode).

## Features

### 🚢 Live 3D terminal
- Quay cranes run full discharge and load cycles: trolley out, spreader down, lift, swing, set down. Discharge counts tick up live.
- Vessels berth, work cargo and sail. Tugs push from the seaward side and cast off.
- Trucks loop through the gates and yard lanes, each leaving a fading **comet trail** so you can read its direction at a glance.
- Click any vessel, crane, yard block, container, truck or facility. The camera flies to it and a detail card opens.

### 📡 AIS-realistic ship movement
- Ships never follow canned paths. They move **only** from simulated **AIS Class A position reports** (ITU-R M.1371 messages 1/2/3), each one encoded to and decoded from real **NMEA 0183 `!AIVDM`** sentences.
- Reporting intervals follow the standard: 10 s under way, 3⅓ s while turning, 3 min when moored or anchored. Reports include GNSS noise, ~3–8% missed slots and receive latency.
- Between fixes the hull is **dead-reckoned** from SOG, COG and ROT, then eased onto each new fix over 2.2 s.
- A 3D overlay shows a dashed past track, diamond fixes and a 1-minute COG/SOG vector.
- The **AIS tab** shows nav status, link health (Receiving / Signal stale / Target lost), SOG·COG·HDG·ROT, DMS position, MMSI, call sign, draught, destination, reception % and a raw sentence feed.

### ⚓ Real port-call choreography
Each voyage is a continuous chain of legs: *sea passage → anchorage → pilotage → tug-assisted berthing → alongside → unberthing → outbound*. Every nav-status change is a forced AIS report.

This morning's scenario:
- **ORIENT LOTUS** comes in from the Strait, anchors at the Western Anchorage, picks up an MPA pilot and berths at B3 (09:50).
- **MERLION STAR** finishes cargo, STS-01 raises its boom, and she unberths from B1 at 09:51 and joins the eastbound lane.
- **BLUE MARLIN** anchors to wait for her 13:30 berth window.
- Eight regional feeders and coasters transit the TSS, keeping to starboard between IALA-A lane buoys.

### ⏱️ Time machine
- A global **time bar** with play/pause, rewind and fast-forward (×2 / ×8 / ×32), ±30 s jumps and a scrubber over the **last hour**.
- Severity-coloured **event markers** on the scrubber jump to the moment and fly the camera to the target.
- Every animation, KPI, alert and log line is a **pure function of sim time**, so replay matches what happened exactly, down to each crane's trolley position.

### 🏭 Logistics district
- **AYE expressway** viaduct with left-hand traffic and Singapore-green overhead signs.
- **Tuas ITH Rail Terminal** with a 16-flatcar shuttle on a 12-minute cycle, two RMG cranes and level-crossing barriers.
- CFS, an FTZ warehouse, a cold chain hub, an **ICA inspection centre with a drive-through X-ray portal**, a truck staging lot and a service station.
- A distribution centre with rooftop solar, an M&R depot, semiconductor, pharma, food and steel plants, flour mill silos and a **bunker terminal** with a tanker at the jetty.
- Drayage trucks shuttle between the terminal and the district. Every site has a live status line and an info card.

### 🌙 Night view
- One toggle eases the scene into night. Crane floods, red aviation beacons, sodium yard masts, ship navigation lights (red port, green starboard, white masthead), truck head and tail lights, buoy blinkers and lit windows all come on.
- The HUD stays on light paper, so the UI is always readable.

### ☸️ Live cluster mode
- The **Simulation / Live cluster** switch turns the scene into a read-only map of a Kubernetes cluster through a local `kubectl proxy`. No credentials ever reach the browser.
- Nodes become vessels, namespaces become yard blocks, pods become containers on deck and in the yard, and workloads become shipments with a rollout timeline.
- Trucks are driven by cluster events: an image pull is a truck arriving through the gate, a scheduling decision is a terminal tractor, and quiet lanes keep an empty grey shuttle moving so the yard stays readable.
- The HUD switches to Kubernetes words (Node, Pod, Workload, Rollout) and pins the location to Miami, where the cluster behind the demo lives.

### 🧭 Operator HUD
- **KPIs**: TEU today, crane productivity, on-time berthing, yard utilisation.
- **Alerts**: late vessels, gate congestion, wind stops. Click one to fly the camera to it.
- **24 h berth plan** Gantt chart with a moving now-line.
- **⌘K command palette** to search vessels, containers, trucks, shipments, blocks, cranes and logistics sites.
- **Hide panels** mode for a clean view of the whole map.
- A polished **boot screen** that preloads fonts, the 3D engine, the scene, the shaders and the first frames, so the port is fully warm when it appears.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.1+** (recommended). npm or pnpm also work with the standard `package.json` scripts.
- **Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+**, which Vite 8 requires.
- A desktop browser with **WebGL 2** and hardware acceleration turned on.

### Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portwise.git
cd portwise/web-portwise

bun install
bun run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080**.

With [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) installed, `mise run dev` from anywhere in the repo does the same with the pinned Bun version.

### Production build

```bash
bun run build      # outputs to web-portwise/dist
bun run preview    # serves the production build locally
```

No environment variables are needed. The app is fully static. Only the optional [live cluster mode](#live-cluster-mode) talks to a server.

---

## Available scripts

Run these from `web-portwise/`:

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Start the Vite dev server on port 8080 with HMR |
| `bun run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `bun run build:dev` | Build in development mode (unminified, easier to debug) |
| `bun run preview` | Serve the built `dist/` locally |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint over the project |
| `bun run k8s:proxy` | Read-only `kubectl proxy` on port 8001 for [live cluster mode](#live-cluster-mode); needs `KUBE_CONTEXT` |
| `bun run test` | Run unit tests, then browser tests |
| `bun run test:watch` | Unit tests in watch mode |
| `bun run test:browser` | Browser tests (Vitest + Playwright Chromium) in watch mode |

Type check only:

```bash
bun x tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit
```

---

## Live cluster mode

The simulation is the default. The **Simulation / Live cluster** switch in the top bar swaps it for a read-only view of a Kubernetes cluster. The choice is remembered per browser.

### Run it

In one terminal, start a read-only API proxy for the context you want to view:

```bash
cd web-portwise
KUBE_CONTEXT=my-cluster bun run k8s:proxy
```

In another, start the app and pick **Live cluster** in the top bar:

```bash
bun run dev
```

With [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), put your values in a `mise.local.toml` at the repo root (it is gitignored) and run `mise run k8s:proxy` and `mise run dev` from anywhere in the repo:

```toml
[env]
KUBE_CONTEXT = "my-cluster"
PORTWISE_PORT = "5180"
```

The browser never sees credentials. The Vite dev server forwards `/k8s/*` to the proxy, and `kubectl proxy` signs requests with your local kubeconfig. The proxy rejects `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` and `CONNECT`, and the app only issues `GET` list and watch requests.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KUBE_CONTEXT` | none, required | kubeconfig context for `bun run k8s:proxy` |
| `K8S_PROXY_PORT` | `8001` | Port `bun run k8s:proxy` listens on |
| `K8S_PROXY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` | Where the dev server forwards `/k8s/*` |
| `PORTWISE_PORT` | `8080` | Dev server port; when set, startup fails instead of picking another port |
| `VITE_K8S_API_BASE` | `/k8s` | API base URL the browser calls |

The status pill next to the switch shows **Connecting**, **Live**, **Error** or **Start kubectl proxy** when the API is unreachable. Hover it for the reason.

### What changes in live mode

- The HUD speaks Kubernetes: **Node**, **Pod**, **Workload**, **Rollout**, and the search box looks for nodes, pods and workloads.
- The time bar loses rewind and scrubbing. A watch stream only has the present, so the clock just runs.
- The location pill reads **Live cluster · Miami** and the top bar shows the current operator.
- The quay is laid out for the nodes you have: one berth per node, compressed to fit when there are many. Hull length follows allocatable CPU.
- Shipments, AIS strait traffic and the logistics district stay simulated. Everything on the quay, in the yard and on the roads inside the terminal comes from the cluster.

### How the cluster reads as a port

| Cluster | Port |
| --- | --- |
| Node | Vessel at its own berth, in name order. Ready, cordoned and not-ready nodes get different headlines |
| Pod on a node | Container on that vessel's deck, coloured by namespace. Click one for its card |
| Namespace | Yard block, coloured by namespace; the 40 busiest get a block, the rest are summarised as overflow |
| Pod in a block | Container in its namespace's block |
| Pending or unscheduled pod | Counted on the anchorage marker |
| Pod scheduled onto a node | The quay crane at that node's berth works for about two lift cycles |
| Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Job | Shipment with a rollout timeline: Created, Scheduled, Initialized, Containers ready, Rolled out |
| Warning event | Alert, linked to the node, pod or namespace it concerns |

### Trucks

Trucks are the only thing that visibly moves on the ground, so they are driven by what the cluster is doing right now. Trips replay from the real event time, play once, and age out after 15 minutes.

| Event | Truck |
| --- | --- |
| `Pulling` then `Pulled` | External truck from the gate to the node's apron. The plate is the image, the carrier is the registry, and the wait on the apron is the real pull time |
| `Pulled` with no `Pulling` | Same trip with a short stop labelled **Already on node**, since the kubelet only logs `Pulled` for cached images |
| `Scheduled` | Terminal tractor from the namespace's yard block to the node's crane, carrying the pod. Namespaces without a block arrive through the gate instead |

Between events, up to 12 **steady-state shuttles** loop between a namespace's block and each node running its pods, busiest lanes first. They are drawn as empty grey tractors with a **STEADY STATE** label so they are never mistaken for a real movement. Clicking one explains what it stands for.

### Where the mapping lives

The whole mapping is data in `web-portwise/src/source/k8s/mapping.ts`: vocabulary, colours, berth and crane rules, alert severities, rollout steps and every truck parameter. `project.ts` applies it to the cluster state kept by `reducer.ts`, and `trips.ts` turns events into truck routes. The 3D scene and HUD only ever see the resulting port model in `src/source/model.ts`, so changing what a namespace or node becomes never touches rendering code.

## Architecture

### One sim clock for everything

`src/sim/simStore.ts` owns a single **simulation clock**. Sim time `t` is in seconds relative to **09:44:00 SGT**. The clock can be live, paused, or playing at any rate from −32× to +32×, and it is clamped to a one-hour replay window (`MIN_T = -3600`).

Everything that moves or counts is a **pure function of `t`**:

```ts
const t = simT();                           // read once per frame
const status = craneStatusAt(crane, t);     // working / waiting / wind stop
const fix = aisFix(vesselId, t, scratch);   // ship pose from AIS reports received by t
const train = trainAt(t);                   // rail shuttle phase and slot contents
```

No component keeps its own timers or accumulates per-frame deltas. That is why scrubbing backwards, pausing mid-lift or fast-forwarding at ×32 always shows exactly the state the port was in at that moment. When you add new motion, **derive it from `t`; never integrate it.**

React subscribes through `useSyncExternalStore` with throttled notifications. 3D components read the clock directly inside `useFrame` and write to refs and instanced buffers, so the React tree does not re-render 60 times a second.

### AIS-driven ship motion

```text
voyage.ts (ground truth legs)
      │  sample at ITU-R M.1371 intervals, add GNSS noise, drop ~3–8% of slots
      ▼
nmea.ts  encodePositionReport() ──► "!AIVDM,1,1,,A,15M…,0*5C"
      │  receive latency
      ▼
nmea.ts  decodeAivdm() ──► PositionReport (quantised like the wire format)
      │
      ▼
tracker.ts aisFix(id, t)  → last received report + dead reckoning (SOG/COG/ROT arc)
                          → 2.2 s blend onto each new fix
                          → stale / lost flags (6 min for Class A)
                          → snap to berth when moored
      │
      ▼
Vessel.tsx / AisOverlay.tsx / AisPanel.tsx
```

Report field names follow the **AISStream.io JSON schema**, so a real feed could replace the simulated one later without touching the tracker or the UI.

Scene geometry: north is −z, east is +x, and **1 scene unit = 3 m**. `geo.ts` projects between WGS-84 and scene units on a local tangent plane.

### Rendering the port

- **Instancing everywhere.** Yard containers, trees, buildings, cars and lights are `InstancedMesh`es. Per-frame updates write matrices or colours in place.
- **Floating labels** (`Chip3D`) use drei's `<Html>` and stay below the HUD in z-order. 3D signage uses troika SDF `<Text>` with a bundled font.
- **Night mode** blends one `nightFx.mix` value (0 → 1 over ~1.5 s) that drives sky, fog, hemisphere light, water colour and the opacity of additive glow sprites and ground light pools.
- **Selection** uses an orange emissive tint on parts plus a world-space outline on hulls and containers. Hover uses a lighter tint.
- **Adaptive resolution** with drei's `<AdaptiveDpr>` keeps the frame rate up on weaker GPUs.

### Boot sequence

`BootScreen` stays up until all five stages in `src/state/boot.ts` are done:

| Stage | Done when |
| --- | --- |
| `fonts` | Every UI font weight loads (`document.fonts.load`, capped at 4.5 s) |
| `engine` | The lazy `PortScene` chunk resolves and the `<Canvas>` is created |
| `scene` | The scene's `<Suspense>` boundary resolves (models, SDF fonts, district) |
| `shaders` | `renderer.compileAsync(scene, camera)` finishes |
| `frames` | 12 warm frames render (shadow maps, text atlases, instance buffers) |

Then the cover fades out, the HUD mounts and the camera fly-in starts. A 30 s safety timeout makes sure the app always opens.

### State management

| Store | Kind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `simStore` | Module store + `useSyncExternalStore` | Clock, replay controls, derived live numbers, alerts, events |
| `PortProvider` | React context (`@nkzw/create-context-hook`) | Current selection, camera focus, route sync |
| `source/store` | Module store, persisted to `localStorage` | Simulation / live cluster switch |
| `k8s/liveStore` | Module store | Cluster watch, connection status, projected live snapshot |
| `nightMode` | Module store, persisted to `localStorage` | Day/night toggle |
| `hudVisibility` | Module store | Hide panels |
| `boot` | Module store | Boot progress and reveal |

Module-level stores let both the HUD and the 3D scene read shared state without prop drilling or extra renders.

---

## Customising the simulation

All scenario data lives in plain TypeScript under `src/data/` and `src/sim/`:

| What to change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Port name, carrier, vessels, cranes, trucks, alerts | `src/data/port.ts` |
| How a Kubernetes cluster reads as a port | `src/source/k8s/mapping.ts` |
| Yard containers and shipments | `src/data/containers.ts` |
| Logistics facilities | `src/data/facilities.ts` |
| Drayage runs | `src/data/drayage.ts` |
| Colours and layout constants | `src/data/layout.ts` |
| Start time, time zone, replay window | `src/sim/constants.ts` |
| Port calls (arrivals, departures, anchorage) | `src/sim/ais/portCalls.ts` |
| AIS static data (MMSI, call sign, size, draught) | `src/sim/ais/static.ts` |
| Map origin (lat/lon) and scale | `src/sim/ais/geo.ts` |
| Rail shuttle and customs cycles | `src/sim/logistics.ts` |

Tips:
- Keep new motion **deterministic in `t`**. If something needs randomness, seed it from an ID, never from `Math.random()` per frame.
- A port call is a list of legs, each ending at an absolute sim time. Make legs continuous in position and speed, and the tracker and UI will pick them up automatically.
- To move the terminal somewhere else, update `GEO_ORIGIN`, `UTC_OFFSET_SEC`, names in `port.ts` and the traffic side in the district roads.

## Design system

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cream canvas | `#F3EFE6` | Land, page background |
| Paper | `#FFFDF8` | Panels |
| Hairline | `#E3DDD0` | Borders |
| Sand | `#EDE8DC` | Fills, tracks |
| Ink | `#12233F` | Text, primary actions |
| Signal | `#F2622E` | Selection, cranes, live, current step |
| Moss | `#2F8F6B` | Success, live state |
| Amber | `#E8A317` | Warnings |
| Brick | `#C8423B` | Danger, stops |
| Harbor | `#2C6FB0` | Info, AIS tracks |
| Water | `#BFDCD6` → `#9CC8C2` | Shallow → deep |

- **Type:** Be Vietnam Pro (400–800) for all UI text. JetBrains Mono (500–700, tabular figures) for vessel IDs, container numbers, plates, times and KPIs.
- **Panels:** 14 px radius, 1 px hairline border, soft ink shadow. Status chips are tinted pills with a 6 px dot.
- **Rules:** no purple, no glassmorphism, no dark-mode UI. The 3D night view is the only dark surface.

## Performance notes

- Portwise is built for **desktop GPUs**. Integrated graphics from the last few years run it smoothly. Software rendering (no GPU, some VMs and CI runners) works but is slow.
- If the frame rate drops, use **Hide panels** (H) and avoid zooming fully out at night, which is when the most glow sprites are on screen.
- Make sure your browser has hardware acceleration turned on (Chrome: *Settings → System → Use graphics acceleration when available*).
- The 3D engine and scene load in a separate lazy chunk, so the first paint (the boot screen) is fast.

## Browser support

| Browser | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome / Edge 113+ | ✅ Recommended |
| Firefox 115+ | ✅ Supported |
| Safari 17+ (macOS) | ✅ Supported |
| Mobile browsers | ⚠️ Renders, but the layout is designed for screens ≥ 1280 px wide |

## Deployment

The build output in `web-portwise/dist` is a static single-page app, so any static host works: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront, and so on.

Because routes like `/vessels/:id` are handled on the client, set up an **SPA fallback** so unknown paths serve `index.html`:

**Netlify** (`web-portwise/public/_redirects`)
```text
/*  /index.html  200
```

**Vercel** (`web-portwise/vercel.json`)
```json
{ "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }] }
```

**Cloudflare Pages** handles SPA fallback automatically when there is no `404.html`.

If you deploy to your own domain, update the absolute `og:url`, `og:image` and `twitter:image` URLs in `web-portwise/index.html`.

## Roadmap

Ideas the project is open to:

- [ ] Plug in a live AIS feed (e.g. AISStream.io WebSocket) behind the existing tracker
- [ ] Multi-terminal switching (Tuas, Jurong)
- [ ] Level-of-detail labels that hide trucks and blocks when zoomed out
- [ ] Unit tests for the NMEA encoder/decoder and the dead-reckoning tracker
- [ ] More live sources behind `src/source/model.ts` (Nomad, Docker, a CI queue)
- [ ] Live shipments and logistics district from cluster data
- [ ] Shareable deep links to a moment in time (`?t=…`)
- [ ] Localisation of the HUD
- [ ] Responsive tablet layout

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome, from bug reports and design polish to new simulation features.

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`.
2. Install and run: `cd web-portwise && bun install && bun run dev`.
3. Make your change. Please keep to these rules:
   - TypeScript strict, no `any`, explicit types on state.
   - **All motion is a pure function of sim time** so replay stays exact.
   - Reuse the existing design tokens. Don't add new colours or fonts without discussion.
   - Prefer instancing and refs in `useFrame` over React state for anything per-frame.
4. Check your work:
   ```bash
   bun run lint
   bun x tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit
   bun run test
   bun run build
   ```
5. Open a **pull request** with a short description and, for visual changes, a screenshot or a short clip.

For larger changes, please open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.
